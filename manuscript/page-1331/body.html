Her voice sounded in an unnatural and jarring tone.</p><p>"We ran up against each other in the doorway."</p><p>"And he bowed to you like this?"</p><p>She drew a long face, and half-closing her eyes, quickly transformed her expression, folded her hands, and Vronsky suddenly saw in her beautiful face the very expression with which Alexey Alexandrovitch had bowed to him. He smiled, while she laughed gaily, with that sweet, deep laugh, which was one of her greatest charms.</p><p>"I don’t understand him in the least," said Vronsky. "If after your avowal to him at your country house he had broken with you, if he had called me out—but this I can’t understand. How can he put up with such a position? He feels it, that’s evident."</p></div> </div>
