<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> A high, narrow carriage with a pair of grays was standing at the entrance. He recognized Anna’s carriage. "She is coming to me," thought Vronsky, "and better she should. I don’t like going into that house. But no matter; I can’t hide myself," he thought, and with that manner peculiar to him from childhood, as of a man who has nothing to be ashamed of, Vronsky got out of his sledge and went to the door. The door opened, and the hall porter with a rug on his arm called the carriage. Vronsky, though he did not usually notice details, noticed at this moment the amazed expression with which the porter glanced at him. In the very doorway Vronsky almost ran up against Alexey Alexandrovitch. The gas jet threw its full light on the bloodless, sunken face under the black hat and on the white cravat, brilliant against the beaver of the coat. Karenin’s fixed, dull eyes were fastened upon Vronsky’s face.</p></div> </div>
