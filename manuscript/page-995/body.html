<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"You’re like a hen with your chickens, Darya Alexandrovna."</p><p>"Ah, how glad I am to see you!" she said, holding out her hand to him.</p><p>"Glad to see me, but you didn’t let me know. My brother’s staying with me. I got a note from Stiva that you were here."</p><p>"From Stiva?" Darya Alexandrovna asked with surprise.</p><p>"Yes; he writes that you are here, and that he thinks you might allow me to be of use to you," said Levin, and as he said it he became suddenly embarrassed, and, stopping abruptly, he walked on in silence by the wagonette, snapping off the buds of the lime trees and nibbling them. He was embarrassed through a sense that Darya Alexandrovna would be annoyed by receiving from an outsider help that should by rights have come from her own husband.</p></div> </div>
