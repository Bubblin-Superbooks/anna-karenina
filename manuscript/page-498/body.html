Stepping noiselessly over the thick rugs, he went up to Princess Myakaya.</p><p>"How did you like Nilsson?" he asked.</p><p>"Oh, how can you steal upon anyone like that! How you startled me!" she responded. "Please don’t talk to me about the opera; you know nothing about music. I’d better meet you on your own ground, and talk about your majolica and engravings. Come now, what treasure have you been buying lately at the old curiosity shops?"</p><p>"Would you like me to show you? But you don’t understand such things."</p></div> </div>
