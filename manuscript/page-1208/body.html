Levin, getting his provisions out of his carriage, invited the old man to take tea with him.</p><p>"Well, I have had some today already," said the old man, obviously accepting the invitation with pleasure. "But just a glass for company."</p><p>Over their tea Levin heard all about the old man’s farming. Ten years before, the old man had rented three hundred acres from the lady who owned them, and a year ago he had bought them and rented another three hundred from a neighboring landowner.

The old man complained that things were doing badly.</p></div> </div>
