Varenka came, however, in the evening and brought a roll of music with her. The princess had invited Marya Yevgenyevna and her daughter and the colonel.</p><p>Varenka seemed quite unaffected by there being persons present she did not know, and she went directly to the piano.

Kitty, who played well, accompanied her.</p><p>"You have an extraordinary talent," the princess said to her after Varenka had sung the first song extremely well.</p></div> </div>
