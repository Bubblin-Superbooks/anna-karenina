He stopped at the door, and, taking off his cap, let her pass. Anna recognized him, and only then recalled that Vronsky had told her the day before that he would not come. Most likely he was sending a note to say so.</p><p>As she took off her outer garment in the hall, she heard the footman, pronouncing his "r’s" even like a Kammerjunker, say, "From the count for the princess," and hand the note.</p></div> </div>
