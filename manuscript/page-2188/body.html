Veslovsky called to him. "Excuse me, I’ve only just finished my ablutions," he said, smiling, standing before him in his underclothes only.</p><p>"Don’t mind me, please." Levin sat down in the window. "Have you slept well?"</p><p>"Like the dead. What sort of day is it for shooting?"</p><p>"What will you take, tea or coffee?"</p><p>"Neither. I’ll wait till lunch. I’m really ashamed. I suppose the ladies are down? A walk now would be capital. You show me your horses."</p></div> </div>
