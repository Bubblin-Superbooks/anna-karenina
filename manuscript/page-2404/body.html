I’ll tell you my own case. Before I took to seeing after the land, I had a salary of three hundred pounds from the service. Now I do more work than I did in the service, and like you I get five per cent. on the land, and thank God for that. But one’s work is thrown in for nothing."</p><p>"Then why do you do it, if it’s a clear loss?"</p><p>"Oh, well, one does it! What would you have? It’s habit, and one knows it’s how it should be. And what’s more," the landowner went on, leaning his elbows on the window and chatting on, "my son, I must tell you, has no taste for it. There’s no doubt he’ll be a scientific man. So there’ll be no one to keep it up. And yet one does it. Here this year I’ve planted an orchard."</p></div> </div>
