At the entrance of the garden they met the blind lady, Madame Berthe, with her guide, and the prince was delighted to see the old Frenchwoman’s face light up when she heard Kitty’s voice. She at once began talking to him with French exaggerated politeness, applauding him for having such a delightful daughter, extolling Kitty to the skies before her face, and calling her a treasure, a pearl, and a consoling angel.</p><p>"Well, she’s the second angel, then," said the prince, smiling. "she calls Mademoiselle Varenka angel number one."</p><p>"Oh! Mademoiselle Varenka, she’s a real angel, allez," Madame Berthe assented.</p></div> </div>
