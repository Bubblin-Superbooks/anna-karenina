But this great set has its subdivisions. Anna Arkadyevna Karenina had friends and close ties in three different circles of this highest society.

Anna found it difficult now to recall the feeling of almost awe-stricken reverence which she had at first entertained for these persons.

She knew their relations with one another and with the head authorities, knew who was for whom, and how each one maintained his position, and where they agreed and disagreed.</p></div> </div>
