What she disliked particularly was seeing Princess Varvara ready to overlook everything for the sake of the comforts she enjoyed.</p><p>As a general principle, abstractly, Dolly approved of Annaâ€™s action; but to see the man for whose sake her action had been taken was disagreeable to her. Moreover, she had never liked Vronsky. She thought him very proud, and saw nothing in him of which he could be proud except his wealth. But against her own will, here in his own house, he overawed her more than ever, and she could not be at ease with him.
