Splendid!"</p><p>Sviazhsky went up to Levin and invited him to come round to tea with him. Levin was utterly at a loss to comprehend or recall what it was he had disliked in Sviazhsky, what he had failed to find in him. He was a clever and wonderfully good-hearted man.</p><p>"Most delighted," he said, and asked after his wife and sister-in-law.
