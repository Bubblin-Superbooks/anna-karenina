At last Vronsky, without waiting for the artist, walked away to another small picture.</p><p>"Oh, how exquisite! What a lovely thing! A gem! How exquisite!" they cried with one voice.</p><p>"What is it they’re so pleased with?" thought Mihailov. He had positively forgotten that picture he had painted three years ago. He had forgotten all the agonies and the ecstasies he had lived through with that picture when for several months it had been the one thought haunting him day and night. He had forgotten, as he always forgot, the pictures he had finished. He did not even like to look at it, and had only brought it out because he was expecting an Englishman who wanted to buy it.</p></div> </div>
