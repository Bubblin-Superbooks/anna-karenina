<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"I can never forget what is my whole life. For one instant of this happiness..."</p><p>"Happiness!" she said with horror and loathing and her horror unconsciously infected him. "For pityâ€™s sake, not a word, not a word more."</p><p>She rose quickly and moved away from him.</p><p>"Not a word more," she repeated, and with a look of chill despair, incomprehensible to him, she parted from him. She felt that at that moment she could not put into words the sense of shame, of rapture, and of horror at this stepping into a new life, and she did not want to speak of it, to vulgarize this feeling by inappropriate words. But later too, and the next day and the third day, she still found no words in which she could express the complexity of her feelings; indeed, she could not even find thoughts in which she could clearly think out all that was in her soul.</p></div> </div>
