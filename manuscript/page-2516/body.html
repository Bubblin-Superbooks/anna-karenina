Stepan Arkadyevitch took the glass, and looking towards a bald man with red mustaches at the other end of the table, he nodded to him, smiling.</p><p>"Who’s that?" asked Levin.</p><p>"You met him once at my place, don’t you remember? A good-natured fellow."</p><p>Levin did the same as Stepan Arkadyevitch and took the glass.</p><p>Stepan Arkadyevitch’s anecdote too was very amusing. Levin told his story, and that too was successful. Then they talked of horses, of the races, of what they had been doing that day, and of how smartly Vronsky’s Atlas had won the first prize. Levin did not notice how the time passed at dinner.</p></div> </div>
