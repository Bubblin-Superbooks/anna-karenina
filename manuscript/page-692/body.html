He did not go up the steps to the street door, but went into the court.</p><p>"Has your master come?" he asked a gardener.</p><p>"No, sir. The mistress is at home. But will you please go to the front door; there are servants there," the gardener answered. "They’ll open the door."</p><p>"No, I’ll go in from the garden."</p><p>And feeling satisfied that she was alone, and wanting to take her by surprise, since he had not promised to be there today, and she would certainly not expect him to come before the races, he walked, holding his sword and stepping cautiously over the sandy path, bordered with flowers, to the terrace that looked out upon the garden.</p></div> </div>
