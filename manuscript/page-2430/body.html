Another nobleman jocosely described how footmen in stockings had been ordered for the marshal’s ball, and how now they would have to be sent back unless the new marshal would give a ball with footmen in stockings.</p><p>Continually during dinner they said of Nevyedovsky: "our marshal," and "your excellency."</p><p>This was said with the same pleasure with which a bride is called "Madame" and her husband’s name.
