"I met Vronsky at the railway station."</p><p>"Oh, was he there?" asked Kitty, blushing. "What was it Stiva told you?"</p><p>"Stiva gossiped about it all. And I should be so glad ... I traveled yesterday with Vronsky’s mother," she went on; "and his mother talked without a pause of him, he’s her favorite.
