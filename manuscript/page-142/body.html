Stepan Arkadyevitch sighed, remembering his position with his wife, and, after a moment’s silence, resumed—"She has a gift of foreseeing things. She sees right through people; but that’s not all; she knows what will come to pass, especially in the way of marriages. She foretold, for instance, that Princess Shahovskaya would marry Brenteln. No one would believe it, but it came to pass. And she’s on your side."</p></div> </div>
