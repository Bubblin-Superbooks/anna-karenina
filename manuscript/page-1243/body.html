<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Sviazhsky’s study was a huge room, surrounded by bookcases and with two tables in it—one a massive writing table, standing in the middle of the room, and the other a round table, covered with recent numbers of reviews and journals in different languages, ranged like the rays of a star round the lamp. On the writing table was a stand of drawers marked with gold lettering, and full of papers of various sorts.</p><p>Sviazhsky took out the books, and sat down in a rocking-chair.</p><p>"What are you looking at there?" he said to Levin, who was standing at the round table looking through the reviews.</p></div> </div>
