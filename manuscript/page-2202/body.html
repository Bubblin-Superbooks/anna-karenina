She was walking about the room, talking angrily to a little girl, who stood in the corner roaring.</p><p>"And you shall stand all day in the corner, and have your dinner all alone, and not see one of your dolls, and I won’t make you a new frock," she said, not knowing how to punish her.</p><p>"Oh, she is a disgusting child!" she turned to Levin. "Where does she get such wicked propensities?"</p><p>"Why, what has she done?" Levin said without much interest, for he had wanted to ask her advice, and so was annoyed that he had come at an unlucky moment.</p></div> </div>
