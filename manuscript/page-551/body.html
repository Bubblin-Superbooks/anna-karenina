Forgive me!" she said, sobbing, pressing his hands to her bosom.</p><p>She felt so sinful, so guilty, that nothing was left her but to humiliate herself and beg forgiveness; and as now there was no one in her life but him, to him she addressed her prayer for forgiveness. Looking at him, she had a physical sense of her humiliation, and she could say nothing more. He felt what a murderer must feel, when he sees the body he has robbed of life. That body, robbed by him of life, was their love, the first stage of their love. There was something awful and revolting in the memory of what had been bought at this fearful price of shame.

But in spite of all the murdererâ€™s horror before the body of his victim, he must hack it to pieces, hide the body, must use what he has gained by his murder.</p></div> </div>
