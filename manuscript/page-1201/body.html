<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Darya Alexandrovna sent him a letter, asking him for a side-saddle for Kitty’s use. "I’m told you have a side-saddle," she wrote to him; "I hope you will bring it over yourself."</p><p>This was more than he could stand. How could a woman of any intelligence, of any delicacy, put her sister in such a humiliating position! He wrote ten notes, and tore them all up, and sent the saddle without any reply. To write that he would go was impossible, because he could not go; to write that he could not come because something prevented him, or that he would be away, that was still worse. He sent the saddle without an answer, and with a sense of having done something shameful;</p></div> </div>
