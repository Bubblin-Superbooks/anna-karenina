Come on, Tit! We’ll look sharp! We can eat at night. Come on!" cried voices, and eating up their bread, the mowers went back to work.</p><p>"Come, lads, keep it up!" said Tit, and ran on ahead almost at a trot.</p><p>"Get along, get along!" said the old man, hurrying after him and easily overtaking him, "I’ll mow you down, look out!"</p><p>And young and old mowed away, as though they were racing with one another. But however fast they worked, they did not spoil the grass, and the rows were laid just as neatly and exactly. The little piece left uncut in the corner was mown in five minutes.</p></div> </div>
