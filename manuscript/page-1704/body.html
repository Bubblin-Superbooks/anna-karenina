The thought of her husband’s unhappiness did not poison her happiness. On one side that memory was too awful to be thought of.

The thought of the harm caused to her husband aroused in her a feeling like repulsion, and akin to what a drowning man might feel who has shaken off another man clinging to him. That man did drown.</p></div> </div>
