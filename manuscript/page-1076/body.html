What about Seryozha?" Anna asked, with sudden eagerness, recollecting her son’s existence for the first time that morning.</p><p>"He’s been naughty, I think," answered Annushka with a smile.</p><p>"In what way?"</p><p>"Some peaches were lying on the table in the corner room. I think he slipped in and ate one of them on the sly."</p><p>The recollection of her son suddenly roused Anna from the helpless condition in which she found herself. She recalled the partly sincere, though greatly exaggerated, rôle of the mother living for her child, which she had taken up of late years, and she felt with joy that in the plight in which she found herself she had a support, quite apart from her relation to her husband or to Vronsky. This support was her son.</p></div> </div>
