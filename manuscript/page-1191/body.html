What is it you want of me?"</p><p>"I want you not to meet that man here, and to conduct yourself so that neither the world nor the servants can reproach you ... not to see him. That’s not much, I think. And in return you will enjoy all the privileges of a faithful wife without fulfilling her duties. That’s all I have to say to you. Now it’s time for me to go. I’m not dining at home." He got up and moved towards the door.</p><p>Anna got up too. Bowing in silence, he let her pass before him.</p></div> </div>
