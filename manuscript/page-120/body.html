Taking a run, he dashed down the steps in his skates, crashing and bounding up and down. He flew down, and without even changing the position of his hands, skated away over the ice.</p><p>"Ah, that’s a new trick!" said Levin, and he promptly ran up to the top to do this new trick.</p><p>"Don’t break your neck! it needs practice!" Nikolay Shtcherbatsky shouted after him.</p><p>Levin went to the steps, took a run from above as best he could, and dashed down, preserving his balance in this unwonted movement with his hands. On the last step he stumbled, but barely touching the ice with his hand, with a violent effort recovered himself, and skated off, laughing.</p></div> </div>
