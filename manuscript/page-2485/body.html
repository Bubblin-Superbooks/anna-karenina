<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Lvov was at home, and Levin went in to him unannounced.</p><p>Lvov, in a house coat with a belt and in chamois leather shoes, was sitting in an armchair, and with a pince-nez with blue glasses he was reading a book that stood on a reading desk, while in his beautiful hand he held a half-burned cigarette daintily away from him.</p><p>His handsome, delicate, and still youthful-looking face, to which his curly, glistening silvery hair gave a still more aristocratic air, lighted up with a smile when he saw Levin.</p><p>"Capital! I was meaning to send to you. How’s Kitty? Sit here, it’s more comfortable." He got up and pushed up a rocking chair. "Have you read the last circular in the Journal de St. Petersbourg? I think it’s excellent," he said, with a slight French accent.</p></div> </div>
