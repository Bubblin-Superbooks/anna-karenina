Do I go this way to the marsh?"</p><p>"Straight out at the back; by our threshing floor, my dear, and hemp patches; there’s a little footpath." Stepping carefully with her sunburnt, bare feet, the old woman conducted Levin, and moved back the fence for him by the threshing floor.</p><p>"Straight on and you’ll come to the marsh. Our lads drove the cattle there yesterday evening."</p><p>Laska ran eagerly forward along the little path. Levin followed her with a light, rapid step, continually looking at the sky. He hoped the sun would not be up before he reached the marsh. But the sun did not delay. The moon, which had been bright when he went out, by now shone only like a crescent of quicksilver.</p></div> </div>
