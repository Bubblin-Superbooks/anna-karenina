But now they beamed and exclaimed with delight on recognizing one another. Vronsky would never have expected to be so pleased to see Golenishtchev, but probably he was not himself aware how bored he was. He forgot the disagreeable impression of their last meeting, and with a face of frank delight held out his hand to his old comrade. The same expression of delight replaced the look of uneasiness on Golenishtchev’s face.</p><p>"How glad I am to meet you!" said Vronsky, showing his strong white teeth in a friendly smile.</p><p>"I heard the name Vronsky, but I didn’t know which one. I’m very, very glad!"</p></div> </div>
