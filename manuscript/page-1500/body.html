<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>His brother offered to lend him money, as he would have so many expenses, presents to give....</p><p>"Oh, are presents wanted?" And he galloped to Foulde’s.</p><p>And at the confectioner’s, and at Fomin’s, and at Foulde’s he saw that he was expected; that they were pleased to see him, and prided themselves on his happiness, just as every one whom he had to do with during those days. What was extraordinary was that everyone not only liked him, but even people previously unsympathetic, cold, and callous, were enthusiastic over him, gave way to him in everything, treated his feeling with tenderness and delicacy, and shared his conviction that he was the happiest man in the world because his betrothed was beyond perfection. Kitty too felt the same thing.</p></div> </div>
