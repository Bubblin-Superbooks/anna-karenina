Ladies met them with bouquets of flowers, and followed by the rushing crowd they went into the station.</p><p>One of the ladies, who had met the volunteers, came out of the hall and addressed Sergey Ivanovitch.</p><p>"You too come to see them off?" she asked in French.</p><p>"No, I’m going away myself, princess. To my brother’s for a holiday. Do you always see them off?" said Sergey Ivanovitch with a hardly perceptible smile.</p></div> </div>
