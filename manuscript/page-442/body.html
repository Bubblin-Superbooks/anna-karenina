She knew that there was to be a consultation that day, and though she was only just up after her confinement (she had another baby, a little girl, born at the end of the winter), though she had trouble and anxiety enough of her own, she had left her tiny baby and a sick child, to come and hear Kitty’s fate, which was to be decided that day.</p><p>"Well, well?" she said, coming into the drawing room, without taking off her hat. "You’re all in good spirits.
