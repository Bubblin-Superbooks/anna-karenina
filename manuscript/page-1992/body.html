"But won’t you dine with us?"</p><p>Vronsky gave a hardly perceptible shrug. He was at a complete loss to understand what Anna was about.

Could she possibly think in her position of going to Patti’s benefit, where all the circle of her acquaintances would be? He looked at her with serious eyes, but she responded with that defiant, half-mirthful, half-desperate look, the meaning of which he could not comprehend. At dinner Anna was in aggressively high spirits—she almost flirted both with Tushkevitch and with Yashvin.</p></div> </div>
