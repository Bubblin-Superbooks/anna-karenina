<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"It’s a lovely spring, Vassily."</p><p>"Why, it’s a spring such as the old men don’t remember the like of. I was up home; an old man up there has sown wheat too, about an acre of it. He was saying you wouldn’t know it from rye."</p><p>"Have you been sowing wheat long?"</p><p>"Why, sir, it was you taught us the year before last. You gave me two measures. We sold about eight bushels and sowed a rood."</p><p>"Well, mind you crumble up the clods," said Levin, going towards his horse, "and keep an eye on Mishka. And if there’s a good crop you shall have half a rouble for every acre."</p></div> </div>
