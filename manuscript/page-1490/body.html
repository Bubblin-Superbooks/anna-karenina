<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Mademoiselle Linon had gone away. Without thinking, without asking herself how and what, she had gone up to him, and did as she was doing.</p><p>"Let us go to mamma!" she said, taking him by the hand. For a long while he could say nothing, not so much because he was afraid of desecrating the loftiness of his emotion by a word, as that every time he tried to say something, instead of words he felt that tears of happiness were welling up. He took her hand and kissed it.</p><p>"Can it be true?" he said at last in a choked voice. "I canâ€™t believe you love me, dear!"</p></div> </div>
