Then lightly preening and folding its wings, it disappeared round a corner with a clumsy wag of its tail.</p><p>"Fetch it, fetch it!" shouted Levin, giving Laska a shove from behind.</p><p>"But I can’t go," thought Laska. "Where am I to go? From here I feel them, but if I move forward I shall know nothing of where they are or who they are."
