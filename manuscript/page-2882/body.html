But he could not let off peasants who did not pay their rent, nor let them fall into arrears. It was impossible to overlook the bailiffâ€™s not having mown the meadows and letting the hay spoil; and it was equally impossible to mow those acres where a young copse had been planted. It was impossible to excuse a laborer who had gone home in the busy season because his father was dying, however sorry he might feel for him, and he must subtract from his pay those costly months of idleness. But it was impossible not to allow monthly rations to the old servants who were of no use for anything.</p></div> </div>
