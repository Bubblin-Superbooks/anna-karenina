She was sitting up in bed, holding some knitting, which she had been busy upon during the last few days.</p><p>"Please, don’t be frightened, it’s all right. I’m not a bit afraid," she said, seeing his scared face, and she pressed his hand to her bosom and then to her lips.</p><p>He hurriedly jumped up, hardly awake, and kept his eyes fixed on her, as he put on his dressing gown; then he stopped, still looking at her. He had to go, but he could not tear himself from her eyes. He thought he loved her face, knew her expression, her eyes, but never had he seen it like this. How hateful and horrible he seemed to himself, thinking of the distress he had caused her yesterday. Her flushed face, fringed with soft curling hair under her night cap, was radiant with joy and courage.</p></div> </div>
